00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.480
I seriously hate exams.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.270
Tests are such a drag...

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.360
Gotta do good...

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.030
Man, I just wanna go have fun!

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.440
Study! Study!

6
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.450
Get a load of her, actin' all cool by herself.

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.110
At least an average score...

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.450
No one cares about a loser like you.

9
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.030
What's her deal?

10
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.040
She shoulda just stayed in the nurse's office.

11
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.120
She misses a bit of school and suddenly gets all kinds of special treatment.

12
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.040
Wearin' a sweater instead of a uniform...

13
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.790
Teacher's pet again?

14
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.710
Now if only she'd slit her wrists!

15
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.460
You seriously suck.

16
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.060
Help me...

17
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810
Help me, God!

18
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.060
Your wish...

19
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.820
has been heard loud and clear!

20
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.320
Wait, doesn't this Eidolon seem especially large?

21
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
It is exam season. Everyone's on edge.

22
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.870
With you, this'll be a cinch.

23
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.330
Let's go, Tomone!

24
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.740
Okay, Yato.

25
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.910
Come, Hanki!

26
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.830
Han

27
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.380
Hey! Hey! Hey!

28
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.310
You who would dare desecrate this land of the rising sun!

29
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.650
I now lay waste with the Hanki...

30
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.860
and expel thy vast defilement!

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.120
Rend!

32
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.510
You weren't even a plaything for my Divine Instrument.

33
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.510
Yato? Hey, Yato?

34
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.010
Oh, right.

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.640
Revert, Tomone.

36
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.430
Han

37
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.570
You and your nasty, sweaty hands!

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.150
H-H-How... dare you...

39
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.400
I'm your master!

40
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.160
We need to talk, Yato.

41
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.870
I'm quitting. I won't be your Divine Instrument anymore.

42
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.910
What?

43
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.160
Wait, Tomone. It's only been three months—

44
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.290
I can't take it anymore!
I've had enough! I'm through!

45
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.210
Living like a vagrant with a minor god who doesn't even have a shrine...

46
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.880
Every fiber of my being screams, "No!"

47
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.260
Huh?

48
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.140
Umm... I'm the one who feels like crying...

49
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.520
A-All right! Okay! Fine!

50
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.600
Han
Han

51
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.270
Hanki... I release you.

52
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.310
Han

53
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.070
It's gone!

54
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.200
Just so you know, as a parting piece of wisdom,

55
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.660
it's common courtesy to give a full month's notice before you quit!

56
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.330
Thanks for nothing,

57
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.750
you jobless, tracksuit-wearing drifter who calls himself a god!

58
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.460
So that's the real you, huh!?

59
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.210
Dammit! You'll come crawling back to me once I hit it big!

60
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.460
See ya!

61
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.920
Just you watch!

62
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.220
Soon I'll have 120 million worshippers and stand above all other gods!

63
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.380
You dumbass!

64
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.690
Yato - 365 days a year!
I'll solve any

65
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.190
That lousy Tomone... Can't believe a Divine Instrument actually quit on me...

66
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.070
Gimme a break.

67
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.910
That's better.

68
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.080
I'll never build a shrine with just this much...

69
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.500
Wait, finding a new Divine Instrument comes first!
Yato - 365 days a year!
I'll solve any problem!

70
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.710
Even if I'm a god, I'm basically defenseless without a Divine Instrument !

71
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.590
Or even butt-naked!

72
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.050
I can't go on any jobs like this!

73
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.720
Not like I get many jobs to begin with, though...

74
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.680
Hello! Thank you for calling!

75
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.600
Fast, affordable, and reliable!
Delivery God Yato, at your service!

76
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360
Huh?

77
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.860
Milord has gone missing?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.990
Milord?

Some people actually name their pets like this, huh?
Milord
Missing Cat:

81
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.500
Yeah, like "Lord" or "King" or "God"!

82
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.080
God...

83
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.670
Actually, you named your dog after Zenny's leader, Ami. That's lame!

84
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.880
What do you mean, lame!? Shiina's totally mai waifu!

85
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.550
I'm all about the Hundred Archfiends!

86
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.640
How can you like visual kei?

87
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.390
How can you like Zenny's!?
Milord! Milord!

88
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.970
Zenny's is godlike!

89
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.350
Nope, the Hundred Archfiends are!

90
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.890
Hey, Milord!

91
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.810
Which do you think is more godlike!?

92
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.020
I finished downloading my god!

93
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.280
We're now in the final round of the showdown of the century!

94
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.610
The two circle around and—

95
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.910
Oh, my! He grabs his leg!

96
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.990
How will Tono respond!?

97
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.290
There it is!

98
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.040
His deadly Jungle Savate technique!

99
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.260
Sorry. It was dumb of us to ask your opinion.

100
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.800
I didn't know you were a closet martial arts fan.

101
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.510
I wouldn't say I'm a closet fan...

102
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.510
You haven't told your parents, right?

103
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.690
I think my mother would faint if she found out I'm into this...

104
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.270
"My, how crude!"
Milord!

105
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.690
"Focus on being a proper lady

106
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.940
Milord!

107
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.190
who won't shame the Iki family name!

108
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.730
Milord!

109
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.940
And then someday... land a handsome husband!"

110
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.400
Where be'eth you, Milord!?

111
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.240
Milord!

112
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.410
How do you know how my mom talks!?

113
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.080
Still, Hiyori. Are there any guys you do like besides Tono?

114
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.370
Yeah! Like someone who's closer and more attainable!

115
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.380
Huh? H-Hmm...

116
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.590
Someone I like...

117
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.050
I don't think there is anyone...

118
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.230
Milord!

119
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.150
Hey! Wait!

120
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.110
Don't scamper off, Milord!

121
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.950
Hey!

122
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.840
Hiyori!?

123
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.760
Hey! What happened!?

124
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.590
A girl jumped in front of the bus!

125
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.890
Jumping into the street like that is dangerous, you know!

126
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.230
You could've died!

127
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.390
Oh, err, more importantly...

128
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.310
Hiyori!? Hiyori!?

129
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.190
Say something, Hiyori!

130
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.150
Hiyori!

131
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.690
Is she all right!?

132
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.200
I just called for an ambulance!

133
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.570
Huh?

134
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.820
Huh?

135
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.070
Huh!?

136
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.660
Huh!?

137
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.500
Hiyori!?

138
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.870
Can you hear me!? Hiyori!

139
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.090
Hiyori!

140
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.460
Thank goodness! You're awake!

141
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.720
Are you all right!? Are you in pain!?

142
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720
Hurry, dear! Examine her!

143
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.590
R-Right!

144
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.140
Mm. She seems just fine.

145
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.770
What a relief!

146
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.230
Father...

147
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.280
Your CAT scan looked just fine, and your EEG appears normal too.

148
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.280
You were hit by a bus, but somehow you only suffered a few scratches.

149
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.660
A bus...

150
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.870
I'm worried, dear.

151
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.790
If anything should happen to our precious Hiyori...

152
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.080
Iki General Hospital

153
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.290
This is our hospital, so you
should keep her here awhile!

154
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.040
Come, now. There's a whole list of patients waiting for a vacancy, you know.

155
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.550
But!

156
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.800
What about the other guy who got hit?

157
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.220
Oh, I saw him!

158
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.010
I... think.

159
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.720
Huh? There was no one else there.

160
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.850
Hiyori was just suddenly lying in the street.

161
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.140
Huh?

162
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.940
Hiyori, maybe your memory is still a bit hazy.

163
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.940
But he was there.

164
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.240
Are you sleepy? You must be exhausted.

165
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.860
Take it easy for today.

166
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.990
I'm certain there was a guy there...

167
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.620
Plus...

168
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.080
I somehow remember seeing another me there...

169
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.860
I want to keep living!

170
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.150
Where is she!? I want to see her!

171
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.570
When will they finally let me leave?

172
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.280
Mommy...

173
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.410
It hurts...

174
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.120
It hurts!

175
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.040
My legs hurt so much...

176
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.080
We'll go when you're all better!

177
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.710
What... are these voices?

178
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.050
I can't breathe...

179
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.300
It hurts!

180
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.510
I just want to go outside!

181
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.050
It's hopeless...

182
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.310
You can hear the voices of the Far Shore?

183
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.450
Guess you're okay if you can move like that.

184
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.080
It's you!

185
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.040
Thanks for this morning!

186
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.710
I didn't really need help avoiding that bus,

187
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.380
but you're the first human to ever save me.

188
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.130
Wh-Who are you!?

189
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.970
I'm a god.

190
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.010
Hello, police!?

191
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.260
There's a weird guy in a tracksuit who says he's a god—

192
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.680
Wait, wait, wait!

193
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.270
I really am a genuine, bona fide member of the gods!

194
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.100
I'm the Yato god!

195
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.690
Yato god?

196
00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.110
I've never heard of a god by that name.

197
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.150
Not once!

198
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.740
Well, I'm sort of an up-and-coming stray god right now.

199
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.370
But just you watch!

200
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.460
I'll soon be known far and wide!

241
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.460
I'll become a god that everyone will bow and wish to!

242
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.630
And then...

243
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.510
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

244
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:23.630
Yato

245
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.760
Yato

246
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:23.880
Yato

247
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:23.970
Yato

Yato

266
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:25.550
Yato

267
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.850
I will stand as this land's highest god!

268
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.690
It's going to be a rough one tonight,

269
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.910
plus this place is crawling with 'em.

270
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.910
I can't really stick around
without a Divine Instrument.

271
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.620
Nora's already in use tonight, so...

272
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.410
Wait! That's for me!

273
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.040
Hey, what's your name?

274
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.380
Hiyori. Iki Hiyori.

275
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.250
Hiyori...

276
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.010
All right, I made sure you're okay.

277
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.380
Now we're even!

278
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.510
Huh?

279
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.850
Later!

280
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.020
Wai—

281
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.810
My body feels heavy...

282
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.900
I can't... stay awake...

283
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.110
Ya... to...

284
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.990
God
Stray

285
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.950
Hiyori!

286
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.790
Ami! Yama!

287
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.620
Are you all better?

288
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.120
Yeah!

289
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.500
Man! I'm glad you're okay!

290
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.840
Sorry for worrying you!

291
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.840
Jump into the street again and I'll hit you with a Jungle Savate!

292
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.590
I bet she wouldn't mind a shot from her dear, studly Tono!

293
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.340
Oh, you!

294
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.600
Whoa, Hiyori!

295
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.260
S-Sorry...

296
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.060
I suddenly get really drowsy sometimes...

297
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.770
Huh?

298
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.230
Were you up all night playing video games?

299
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.610
Maybe it was just a dream.

300
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.660
I feel like I met someone that night in the hospital.

301
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.290
Tracksuits...

302
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.210
You feeling all right, Hiyori?

303
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.210
You've been kinda out of it all day.

304
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.800
Yeah. I've just been really sleepy.

305
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.010
Maybe you slept too much in the hospital.

306
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.260
The accident was just the other day.

307
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.100
What is it, Hiyori?

308
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.390
Ue-sama
Missing Cat:

309
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.900
Hmm? Oh, that sign again!

310
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.110
That's right...

311
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.740
I remember there was a guy in a tracksuit

312
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.660
who was chasing this cat...

313
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.830
Milord!

314
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.870
Sorry, you guys.

315
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.210
Go on without me.

316
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.210
Huh?

317
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.830
I...

318
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.050
must henceforth locate Milord.

319
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.800
What!?

320
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.640
Milord!

321
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.890
Milord!

322
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.640
Milord?

323
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.970
Nope...

324
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.390
Milord!

325
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.100
If I find the cat...

326
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.230
I might fully remember.

327
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.320
Milord!

328
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.320
Milord!

329
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.580
I'm feeling drowsy again.

330
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.380
That scent...

331
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.420
Hey!

332
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.550
Milord!

333
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.510
Come out!

334
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.470
I've got some nice catnip!

335
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.810
It's really getting rough now...

336
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.940
Milord!

337
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.950
Wait! Stay right there!

338
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.860
Don't run, now!

339
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.740
What's the matter?

340
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.410
Smells nice...

341
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:32.670
Smells nice... Smells nice...

342
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.550
Smells nice.

343
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.770
They're cannon fodder, but there's a ton of 'em!

344
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.190
Way too many to deal with!

345
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.190
You teased them, didn't you!?

346
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.190
Milord! You've taken your merriment too far!

347
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.330
Smells nice.

348
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.130
In you go.

349
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.680
That did nothing.

350
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.970
Come, Hanki!

351
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.430
Crap! I forgot I don't have a Divine Instrument!

352
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.070
Iki Hiyori!?

353
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.610
What the heck!?

354
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.200
You want a piece of me!?

355
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.580
You idiot! You can't—

356
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.220
Jungle...

357
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.430
Savate!

358
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.150
I-It worked!

359
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.400
The great Tono has paid
me a visit from the heavens!

360
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.820
Oh! I'll be your faithful
follower for as long as I live!

361
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.090
I think we lost it.

362
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.100
Still, this girl saved me again...

363
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.600
We finally meet again, Yato.

364
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.770
I still had a lot to ask you!

365
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.560
But you suddenly ran off...

366
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.190
No dodging the questions this time! Give me straight answers!

367
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.530
Your soul slipped out.

368
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.530
Huh?

369
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.580
Your body's stuck up there.

370
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.740
What!? That's me!?

371
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.370
H-How? Am I dead!?

372
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.170
Not really.

373
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.750
Your body's just asleep.

374
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.810
Sheesh. Some lucky cat you are.

375
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.030
I'll hand out fliers and look some more tomorrow!

376
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.070
Okay?

377
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.400
Don't worry.

378
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.240
I'm sure he'll turn up!

379
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.540
Yes?

380
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.630
Milord!

381
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.380
It's Milord!

382
00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.960
Milord!

383
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.010
My wish really came true!

384
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.550
Thank you, Yato!

385
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.770
Smells nice...

386
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.900
Yuck! Let go of me! Pervert!

387
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.730
I'm no pervert! I'm a god!

388
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.190
Again with that!?

389
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.820
Oh, yeah! My tail!

390
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.910
Huh? It's gone...

391
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.700
What? What's going on?

392
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.990
Was it all a dream?

393
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.370
It wasn't, was it?

394
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.120
What happened to me?

395
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.340
It must've been the accident...

396
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.970
There's the "Near Shore" where the living reside, and then there's the "Far Shore."

397
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.930
You basically wound up in
the divide between them.

398
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.220
The Near Shore and... Far Shore?

399
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.060
Yeah.

400
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.520
I guess the Far Shore is what you guys would call...

401
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.400
the "afterlife."

402
00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.150
You're alive, yet also an Eidolon.

403
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.690
An Eidolon...

404
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.860
They're incarnations of emotional energy.

405
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.780
They possess people and cause all sorts of trouble.

406
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.330
Wait, so that big frog just now was also...

407
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.200
An Eidolon.

408
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.750
What!? I'm the same as that!?

409
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.500
No, not exactly.

410
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.170
Huh?

411
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.710
You're much more... on-the-fence.

412
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.420
Uh... I don't really understand.

413
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.890
Losing your body will be common for you now.

414
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.100
So how can I get better?

415
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.180
I'm not sure you can get better.

416
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.310
This is just the way you are now.

417
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.230
Accept it.

418
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.400
You can't be serious!

419
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.520
I can't live like this! I don't want this! Turn me back!

420
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.740
You're a god, right!? Help me!

421
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:45.990
Money.

422
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.030
You charge money!?

423
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.080
Duh! There's no such thing as a free lunch!

424
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.330
It'll cost ya this much.

425
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.830
Fifty thousand!? Five hundred thousand!?

426
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.960
I don't have that kind of money!

427
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.580
Tch. Fool.

428
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.250
I'm a god, remember!?

429
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.260
And everyone knows you're supposed to offer 5-yen coins to gods!

430
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.550
Fi...

431
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.800
Huh? Umm...

432
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.680
Your wish...

433
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.310
has been heard loud and clear!

434
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560
Iki Hiyori.

435
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.070
May our fates intertwine verily.

436
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.790
Step one in Project: Make Yato a Major God

437
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.620
is to come up with an all-new chant for portable Yato shrines!

438
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.500
What's wrong with regular ol' "heave-ho"?

439
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.840
Instead of "heave-ho," let's use "ya-ho!"

440
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.090
On the next Noragami: "Snow-like."

441
00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.470

442
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.050
Remember! That's, "Ya-ho, Ya-ho, Yato!"
